Motor imagery is a process in which neural activity associated with actual movement is activated by imagining a certain movement without actually performing the physical movement. In this process, the mu rhythm at 8-12 Hz and the beta rhythm at 14-30 Hz in specific corresponding brain regions may show desynchronization followed by synchronization, i.e., the power energy of the corresponding brain regions decreases and then increases, e.g., left-handed motor imagery leads to a decrease and then an increase in the energy of the right brain. This can be determined by changes in electrode signals in different brain regions.
Based on the above domain-specific neuroscience knowledge, classify the following EEG signals in the picture based on motor imagery brain-computer interface as left-handed imagery or right-handed imagery based on the picture. Think step-by-step and end your answer with a strictly “Classification result: ‘left-handed imagery’ or ‘right-handed imagery’.” (The answer should be in the format of.
